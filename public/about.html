<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm currently training as a software developer and recently wrapped up the SQL Bootcamp 
  with Colt Steele. I’ve always enjoyed problem-solving and building things from the ground 
  up, so getting into coding feels like a natural next step. I'm taking it one project at a 
  time and really enjoying the process of learning something completely new. </p>

<p>By trade, I’m a winemaker. I run Mary’s Myth Wines, a small label focused on 
  expressive, minimal-intervention wines. Before that, I spent five years as assistant 
  winemaker at The Lane Vineyard, and cut my teeth making wine in Germany and the U.S. It’s 
  hands-on, creative work that keeps me grounded—and a 
  good reminder that great things take time.</p>

<p>I also play in a band called George Glass, part of the Adelaide Fringe scene. We’ve toured around 
  Australia and even made it to the Edinburgh Fringe. Performing is something I’ve done for years, 
  and it’s a fun way to stay connected to the arts 
  while collaborating with some of my closest mates.</p>
